# **MLOPs Production Ready Machine Learning-Based Visa Certification Prediction for OFLC**  

## **Overview**
This project builds a **classification model** to predict whether visa applications will be **approved** or **denied** for the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC), using historical data. The model automates recommendations based on specific criteria influencing visa decisions, helping OFLC streamline its processes.

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Problem Understanding**
2. **Data Collection**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
5. **Model Training**
6. **Evaluation**
